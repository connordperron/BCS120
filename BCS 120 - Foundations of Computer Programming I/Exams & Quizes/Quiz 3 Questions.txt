//1. Create a function called Golf that returns a random number between 1 and 10.  Create a function called Hotel that uses Golf to simulate rolling two die. Use Hotel to run a simulation of rolling two dice. Go until the dice add up to 12. Output which numbers got you there.
//2. The Fibonacci sequence is: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21, etc. Create a function called fib that returns the nth fibonacci number. That is, a user says, I want the 10th fibonacci number and you return it and display it in main.
//3. Create a function called November that takes in an int grade and a string letter_grade. If grade is between 90 and 100 it should change letter_grade to A. If grade is between 80 and 89 it should change letter_grade to B. If grade is between 70 and 79 it should change letter_grade to C. If grade is lower than 70 it should change letter_grade to “You did not pass”. You should be passing letter_grade in as a reference. Show in main how this works.
